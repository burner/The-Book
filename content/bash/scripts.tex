\section{Scripts}
In this section many useful scripts for daily use will be presented. Every
script will have a small piece of documentation.

\subsection{ASM Scripts}
Scripts that help develop assembler programs.

\subsubsection{Build and Link}
\lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize, numbers=left, captionpos=b, tabsize=4}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Build and Link,language={Bash},
xleftmargin=20pt, label=lst:firstNamsProgram]
#/bin/bash

if [ ! -f $1 ]
then
	echo "file doesn't exists"
	exit
fi

fn=$1
l=${#fn}
l4=$(($l-4))
jn=${fn:${l4}:l}
if [ ! .asm == $jn ] 
then
	echo "fail doesn't end on asm"
	exit
fi

if [ `uname -m` == x86_64 ] 
then
	elfType="elf64"
else
	elfType="elf32"
fi

if [ ! $1 == "-g" ]
then
	debug="-g"
else
	debug=""
fi

nasm -f $elfType ${debug} $1
ld -o ${fn:0:${l4}} ${fn:0:${l4}}.o 
\end{lstlisting}
This script allows you to compile and link an asm file with one call. All you
need to do is pass the filename. The filename must have an .asm at it's end.
If you need debug symbols you can pass another args called -g.
