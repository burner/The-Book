\section{Movement and Scrolling}
One of the key features of vim is its ability for rapid movement within files.
You can however allways use the arrowkeys for movement, but try to avoid this at
any costs.\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\$ & last char of line\\
\hline
$\wedge$ & first char of line\\
\hline
NUMBERk & up\\
\hline
NUMBERj & down\\
\hline
NUMBERh & left\\
\hline
NUMBERl & right\\
\hline
NUMBERw & next word\\
\hline
NUMBERb & prev word\\
\hline
NUMBERf CHAR & jump to next CHAR in line\\
\hline
gg & goto first line\\
\hline
G & goto last line\\
\hline
:NUMBER & goto line NUMBER\\
\hline
NUMBERgg & goto line NUMBER\\
\hline
$<CRTL-y>$ & scroll one line up\\
\hline
$<CRTL-e>$ & scroll one line down\\
\hline
$<CRTL-d>$ & scroll half a page down\\
\hline
$<CRTL-u>$ & scroll half a page up\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\\
Whenever you read a NUMBER you can write a integer number, that will make
perform that operation multiple times.
