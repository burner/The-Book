\section{Relational Calculus} 
The relational calculus allows the user to define what he wants and not how this
shoulb be constructed.
\subsection{Generel From}
$\{t|COND(t)\}$ Where t is the tuplevariable and COND is the condition. The result
is a set of tuple that forfill the condition.\newline
$\{t.A1,t.A2|COND(t)\}$ means that one the attributes A1 and A2 should be returned.

\subsection{Examples}
$\{t|EMPLOYEE(t) and t.SALARY>5000\}$ gives as employees who earn more that
5000.\newline $\{t.SURNAME,t.NAME|EMPLOYEE(t) and t.SALARY > 5000\}$ returns
only the first and the last name of all employees who earn more than 5000.
