Database, ACID
\end{keywords}
Databases work under a closed world assumption, that means that not all Details
of the actual world are took into consideration. Only attributes relevant to the
task are considered. Another imported aspect is that database give every user
the illusion that he is working alone. Therefor four attributes are defined to
make databases work the way the do. These attributes are called ACID.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\item \textbf{Atomicity}: this means that only one operation at a time will change
the database
	\item \textbf{Consistency}: if the database was in a correct state start before any change
happend it will be correct state afterwords
	\item \textbf{Isolation}: everyone using the database thinks he is working alone
	\item \textbf{Durability}: once the transaction is done it is save
\end{itemize}
