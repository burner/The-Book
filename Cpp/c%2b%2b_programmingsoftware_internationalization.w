In Software, Internationalization and localization is how the adapting computer software for other locations, nations or cultures, meaning specifically those that are non-native to the programmer(s) or the primary user group

In specific, Internationalization deals with the process of designing a software application in a way that it can be configured or adapted to work with various languages and regions without heavy changes to the code base. On the other hand Localization deals with the process of enabling the configuration or auto adaptation of the software to a specific region, timezone or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.
