The '''C standard library''' is the C language standardized collection of header files and library routines used to implement common operations, such as input/output and string handling. It became part of the C++ Standard Library as the '''Standard C Library''' in its ANSI C 89 form with some small modifications to make it work better with the C++ Standard Library but remaining outside of the std {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}. Header files in the C++ Standard Library do not end in ".h". However, the C++ Standard Library includes 18 header files from the C Standard Library, with ".h" endings. Their use is deprecated (ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E) ''Programming Languages â€” C++''). 

For a more in depth look into the C programming language check the [[C Programming|C Programming Wikibook]] but be aware of the incompatibilities we have already covered on the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/C|Comparing C++ with C Section]] of this book.
