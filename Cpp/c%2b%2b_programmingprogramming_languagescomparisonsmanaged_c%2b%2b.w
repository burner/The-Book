'''Managed C++''' is a shorthand notation for Managed Extensions for C++, which are part of the [[w:Microsoft .NET|.NET framework]] from [[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]]. This extension of the C++ language was developed to add functionality like automatic garbage collection and heap management, automatic initialization of arrays, and support for multidimensional arrays, simplifying all those  details of programming in C++ that would otherwise have to be done by the programmer.

Managed C++ is not compiled to machine code. Rather, it is compiled to [[w:Common Intermediate Language|Common Intermediate Language]], which is an object-oriented machine language and was formerly known as MSIL.
